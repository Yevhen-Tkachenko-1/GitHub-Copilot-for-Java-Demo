## Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Framework
- IntelliJ IDEA (Community edition)
- GitHub Copilot (Business license)

## Local Preparation

1. Install GitHub Copilot plugin in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Login to GitHub account in IntelliJ IDEA

## Start Interaction

1. Copilot Panel greets you and then propose to try Chat panel.
   There you can ask just one question, so provide all needed context in one message.
   Based on question Copilot provides suggestion and then names conversation.
   There is also Conversation History tab, that doesn't have any information yet.
   Copilot promised that it will be populated once I start writing code and got suggestions.
   For security reasons, this tab doesn't store data from conversation Chat.

1. Writing this text I got suggestions and accepted them by using `Tab` key or `ctrl` + `alt` + `Right` combination for entire text block
   and combination `ctrl` + `Right` for one word.
